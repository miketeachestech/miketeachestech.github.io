In 2024, Year 12 classrooms across the state will begin the [updated HSC Software Engineering curriculum](https://education.nsw.gov.au/teaching-and-learning/curriculum/tas/leading-tas-7-12/software-engineering-11-12-syllabus-information), previously known as Software Design & Development. This transition requires educators and students to adapt to the new syllabus, as older resources and exams are now less relevant. The new curriculum offers a comprehensive program that parallels the content of first-year university IT courses, focusing on object-oriented software development, data structures, and algorithms in Python, and includes essential skills like project management and cybersecurity. Mike offers tutoring services to help navigate these changes. Whether you need occasional support with challenging homework or prefer regular sessions to thoroughly cover each syllabus point, Mike is here to ensure you master all aspects of the new curriculum.
